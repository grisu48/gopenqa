# gopenqa

`gopenqa` is a (intentional bad name for a) openQA module written in go.
The aim of the project is to create an easy-to-use go library for interacting with openQA.

The project is not feature-complete regarding the openQA API. PR extending the internal API to include your needs are welcome.
